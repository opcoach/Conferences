The bundle spy is a common E4 spy.  It will be used as a demo for the Eclipse Con Europe 2014, during my talk.

To use it, import this project in your workspace and add it in your launch configuration. 

It will add a new spy in the E4 spy window, when you open it with ALT SHIFT F12, or when you open the other spies.

Feel free to contribute.
